              Hello! My name is RhaeðŸ˜ƒ Welcome to my little tech world!
            </p>
            <p className="pb-2">
              I'm a passionate and dedicated frontend developer on a mission to
              create innovative solutions that make a positive impact on the
              world.

              My journey as a software engineer began with a deep fascination
              for unlimited possibilities and freedom in tech world. Using
              programming lanuages as tools, building up something from scratch,
              and turning ideas in my head into reality.
            </p>
            <p className="pb-2">
              Past few years working as an accountant taught me research skills,
              analytical thinking, attention to detail and time management.
              Those skills become quite useful when I started my tech journey.
            </p>
            <p>The journey is not easy, but I enjoy it every single day!</p>
